# spotify-app-api

This is a simple backend for my [Spotify project](https://github.com/ForTheOnesThere/spotify-app).

It recieves a code from the user, given to them by Spotify, and makes a request to the Sotify accounts service for a web API key. 

I'm doing this on the backend to the keep the secret private. This backend in deployed on Heroku.
